              Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj has been visible. A story, that although ended back in 1631, continues to live on in the form of Taj and is considered a living example of eternal love. It's the love story of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, two people from the course of history who set an example for the people living in present and the future to come. An English poet, Sir Edwin Arnold best describes it as "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why the statement is true.

              Australia, with its high fees and cost of living, is the world's most expensive destination for international students.

              A study by HSBC found that foreign students were having to fork out more than $42,300 a year on average to study at Australian universities.

              The US is not far behind in total expense, with an average yearly cost of $39,200 (US$35,700) a year, followed by Britain at $33,300 (Â£19,600). About a third of the world's international students are now studying in these two countries, HSBC's report said.

              While Australian fees are roughly on par with US prices, it's the cost of living that makes a big difference, with the yearly average in Australia sitting above $14,400
